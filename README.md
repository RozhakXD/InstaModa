## Issues and Solutions
- **Login Failures**: If you experience login issues, try logging in manually on another device first. After successful login, retry the program.
- **No Followers Added**: If no followers are added, the issue may be that the service you're using has no active users. Try a different service or wait and try again later.
- **Followers Decreasing**: If followers decrease, it might be because their accounts were blocked or marked as spam by Instagram
